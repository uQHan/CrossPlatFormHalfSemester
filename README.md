Press "Show Local Time" to start + receive a notification + a notif sound
Press "Share Time" to share the link to clocktab.com (cause this app is not really shareable)
Press "Capture Screenshot" to capture a screenshot (again, not really cause this is saved in the application context and not anywhere in your devices so uh...)
Yeah...
